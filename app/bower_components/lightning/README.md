#Twigkit Lightning

Twigkit Lightning is a single-page JavaScript framework that supports the same syntax and ease of development for complex business applications as our traditional JSP tag library and supporting services. It is however a simpler way of developing and managing applications since no runtime other than the browser is required for development or deployment.

This redesigned framework represents years of learning in the space where data is requested and rendered as and when it is needed for best-of-breed richness and performance.
