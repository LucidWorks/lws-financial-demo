The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle.

The second type include High-Pass Filter Additive Method (HPFA),\nHigh-Frequency-Addition Method (HFA) High Frequency Modulation Method (HFM) and\nThe Wavelet transform-based fusion method (WT). This paper also devotes to\nconcentrate on the analytical techniques for evaluating the quality of image\nfusion (F) by using various methods including Standard Deviation (SD),\nEntropy(En), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR),\nNormalization Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Deviation Index (DI) to\nestimate the quality and degree of information improvement of a fused image\nquantitatively.", "authors_ss": ["Firouz Abdullah Al-Wassai", "N.

The fusion of two light\nnuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up\nto the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be\nrealized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light\natoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal\nresonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of\nthe deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion\nmechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how\nthese light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of\nmetal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal vibrations and resonances at\ndifferent modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect\nat different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates\nthe thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect,\nis possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very\nsharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for\nthermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or\nmake the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable\ncompound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the\npenetrating probability larger than 10^{-10}.", "authors_ss": ["Bao-Guo Dong"], "published_dt": "2015-07-07T01:21:42Z", "updated_dt": "2015-07-07T01:21:42Z", "abstract_url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01650v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01650v1", "categories": ["nucl-th"]}

Such theories consist\nof additional electroweak charged or singlet states which couple directly to or\nmix with the Higgs boson; particles of this kind may be weakly constrained by\ndirect limits due to their meager production rates and soft decay products. We\npresent a simplified framework which characterizes the effects of these states\non Higgs physics by way of tree level mixing (with neutral scalars) and loop\nlevel modifications (from electrically charged states), all expressed in terms\nof three mixing angles and three loop parameters, respectively. The theory\nparameters are constrained and in some cases even fixed by ratios of Higgs\nproduction and decay rates. Our setup is simpler than a general effective\noperator analysis, in that we discard parameters irrelevant to Higgs\nobservables while retaining complex correlations among measurements that arise\ndue to the underlying mixing and radiative effects. We show that certain\ncorrelated observations are forbidden, e.g. a depleted ratio of Higgs\nproduction from gluon fusion versus vector boson fusion together with a\ndepleted ratio of Higgs decays to bb versus WW. Moreover, we study the strong\ncorrelation between the Higgs decay rate to gamma gamma and WW and how it can\nbe violated in the presence of additional electrically charged particles.

We have argued that during and after core neon burning, internal\ngravity waves excited by core convection can tap into the core fusion power and\ntransport a super-Eddington energy flux out to the stellar envelope,\npotentially unbinding up to ~ 1 solar mass of material. In this work, we\nexplore the internal conditions of SN progenitors using the MESA 1-D stellar\nevolution code, in search of those most susceptible to wave-driven mass loss.\nWe focus on simple, order of magnitude considerations applicable to a wide\nrange of progenitors. Wave-driven mass loss during core neon and oxygen fusion\nhappens preferentially in either lower mass (<~ 20 solar mass ZAMS) stars or\nmassive, sub-solar metallicity stars. Roughly 20 per cent of the SN progenitors\nwe survey can excite ~ 10^46 - 10^48 erg of energy in waves that can\npotentially drive mass loss within a few months to a decade of core collapse.\nThis energy can generate a circumstellar environment with 10^-3 - 1 solar mass\nreaching ~ 100 AU before explosion. We predict a correlation between the energy\nassociated with pre-SN mass ejection and the time to core collapse, with the\nmost intense mass loss preferentially happening closer to core collapse. During\nsilicon burning, a ~ 5 day long phase for our progenitor models, wave energy\nmay inflate ~ 10^-3 - 1 solar mass of the stellar envelope to ~ 10 - 100s of\nsolar radii.

Theoretical\ncalculations with a density constrained time dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF)\ntheory include for the first time the effect of pairing on the fusion\ncross-section. Comparison of the measured fusion excitation function with the\npredictions of the DC-TDHF calculations reveal that the experimental data\nexhibits a smaller decrease in cross-section with decreasing energy than is\ntheoretically predicted. The larger cross-sections observed at the lowest\nenergies measured indicate a larger tunneling probability for the fusion\nprocess. This larger probability can be associated with a smaller, narrower\nfusion barrier than presently included in the theoretical calculations.", "authors_ss": ["T. K. Steinbach", "J. Vadas", "J.

We find that the barrier to formation\nof the initial stalk is much smaller than previously estimated by\nphenomenological theories. Therefore its creation it is not the rate limiting\nprocess.

We\nintroduce the concept of an (f,m)-fusion, which is a set of m backup machines\nthat can correct f crash faults or f/2 Byzantine faults among a given set of\nmachines. Second, we present an algorithm to generate an (f,f)-fusion for a\ngiven set of machines. We ensure that our backups are efficient in terms of the\nsize of their state and event sets. Our evaluation of fusion on the widely used\nMCNC'91 benchmarks for DFSMs show that the average state space savings in\nfusion (over replication) is 38% (range 0-99%). To demonstrate the practical\nuse of fusion, we describe its potential application to the MapReduce\nframework.

The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach.", "authors_ss": ["H. -T. Pai", "Y. S.

While the independence of data from\ncensoring sensors is often assumed in previous research, we explore spatial\ndependence among observations. Our focus is on designing the fusion rule under\nthe Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework that takes into account the spatial\ndependence among observations. Two transmission scenarios are considered, one\nwhere uncensored observations are transmitted directly to the FC and second\nwhere they are first quantized and then transmitted to further improve\ntransmission efficiency. Copula-based Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)\nfor censored data is proposed with both continuous and discrete messages\nreceived at the FC corresponding to different transmission strategies. We\naddress the computational issues of the copula-based GLRTs involving\nmultidimensional integrals by presenting more efficient fusion rules, based on\nthe key idea of injecting controlled noise at the FC before fusion. Although,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by introducing controlled noise at\nthe receiver, simulation results demonstrate that the resulting noise-aided\nfusion approach based on adding artificial noise performs very closely to the\nexact copula-based GLRTs.

Firstly, we provide a principled mathematical definition of \"label\nspaces matching (LS-DM)\" based on information divergence, which is also\nreferred to as LS-M criterion.

To this end, we build a ranked assignment problem and design a cost\nfunction consistent with LS-M criterion to seek the optimal solution of\nmatching correspondence between label spaces of different sensors.

(1998) proposed Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle\ninterface of giant planets as a mechanism to explain their observed heat\nexcess. But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the\neffect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation\nis necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the\nplanet.

It is shown microscopically that the energy\ndissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused\nby the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a\nrearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism\nmonotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on\nthe incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance\nbetween two fusing nuclei and the incident energy.

In this work in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model we focus on vector boson fusion and\nHiggs-strahlung production of heavier scalars that subsequently decay into\npairs of light pseudoscalars. We demonstrate that although these channels have\nin general very limited reach, they are viable for the detection of light\npseudoscalars in some parts of parameter space and can serve as an important\ncomplementary probe to the dominant gluon-fusion production mode. We also\ndemonstrate that in a Higgsfactory these channels may reach sensitivities\ncomparable to or even exceeding the gluon fusion channels at the LHC, thus\npossibly rendering this our best option to discover a light pseudoscalar. It is\nalso worth mentioning that for the singlet dominated scalar this may be the\nonly way to measure its couplings to gauge bosons. Especially promising are\nchannels where the initial scalar is radiated off a W as these events have\nrelatively high rates and provide substantial background suppression due to\nleptons from the W. We identify three benchmark points that well represent the\nabove scenarios. Assuming that the masses of the scalars and pseudoscalars are\nalready measured in the gluon-fusion channel, the event kinematics can be\nfurther constrained, hence significantly improving detection prospects.

But two\nmajor challenges must be overcome to achieve this goal: obtaining average ion\nenergies well above 100keV and minimizing losses by bremsstrahlung x-rays.\nRecent experimental and theoretical work indicates that these challenges may be\novercome with the dense plasma focus. DPF experiments at Texas A&M University\nhave demonstrated ion and electron average energies above 100keV in\nseveral-micron-sized hot-spots or plasmoids. These had\ndensity-confinement-time-energy products as high as 5.0 x10^15 keVsec/cm^3. In\nthese experiments we clearly distinguished between x-rays coming from the\nhot-spots and the harder radiation coming from electron beam collisions with\nthe anode. In addition, new theoretical work shows that extremely high magnetic\nfields, which appear achievable in DPF plasmoids, will strongly reduce\ncollisional energy transfer from ions to electrons. This reduction has been\nstudied in the context of neutron stars and occurs when ion velocities are too\nsmall to efficiently excite electron transitions between Landau levels. It\nbecomes a major effect for fields above 5 gigagauss. This effect will allow\naverage electron energies to stay far below average ion energies and will thus\nreduce x-ray cooling of p11B. In this case, fusion power will very\nsignificantly exceed x-ray emitted power.

The very size of the protein machinery which\nbrings the membranes together can prevent them from reaching this optimum\nseparation. For even modestly larger separations, we find a linear rate of\nincrease of the free energy with distance between bilayers for the metastable\nstalk itself and for the barrier to the creation of this stalk.

The models assume organisms\nwhose genomes consist of two chromosomes, where each chromosome is assumed to\nbe functional if it is equal to some master sequence $ \\sigma_0 $, and\nnon-functional otherwise. The first-order growth rate constant, or fitness, of\nan organism, is determined by whether it has zero, one, or two functional\nchromosomes in its genome. For a population replicating asexually, a given cell\nreplicates both of its chromosomes, and splits its genetic material evenly\nbetween the two cells. For a population replicating sexually, a given cell\nfirst divides into two haploids, which enter a haploid pool, fuse into\ndiploids, and then divide via the normal mitotic process. Haploid fusion is\nmodeled as a second-order rate process. When the cost for sex is small, as\nmeasured by the ratio of the characteristic haploid fusion time to the\ncharacteristic growth time, we find that sexual replication with random haploid\nfusion leads to a greater mean fitness for the population than a purely asexual\nstrategy. However, independently of the cost for sex, we find that sexual\nreplication with a selective mating strategy leads to a higher mean fitness\nthan the random mating strategy.

The FC, upon receiving\na bit decodes the corresponding overshoot and recovers the transmitted LLR\nvalue.

We present two original results: 1) Our first contribution is to show\nhow to recover the Ocneanu graph of quantum symmetries of the Dynkin diagram E6\nfrom the natural multiplication defined in the tensor square of its fusion\nalgebra (the tensor product should be taken over a particular subalgebra); this\nis the Cayley graph for the two generators of the twelve dimensional algebra E6\n\\otimes_A3 E6 and E6 refer to the commutative fusion algebras of the\ncorresponding graphs). 2) To every point of the graph of quantum symmetries one\ncan associate a particular matrix describing the `` torus structure'' of the\nchosen Dynkin diagram; following Ocneanu, one obtains in this way, in the case\nof E6, twelve such matrices of dimension 11x11, one of them is a modular\ninvariant and encodes the partition function of the corresponding conformal\nfield theory.

Or they can in turn fuse with or be captured by\nan un-reacted deuteron. The average center-of-mass (COM) energy for such\nreaction is around 10 keV in a typical fusion reactor, but could be as low as 1\nkeV. At this low COM energy, the reacting nucleons are in an s-wave state in\nterms of their relative angular momentum. The single-gamma radiation process is\nthus strongly suppressed due to conservation laws. Instead the gamma ray\nreleased is likely to be accompanied by x-ray photons from a nuclear\nbremsstrahlung process. The x-ray thus generated has a continuous spectrum and\npeaks around a few hundred eV to a few keV. The average photon energy and\nspectrum properties of such a process are calculated with a semiclassical\napproach. The results give a peak near 1.1 keV for the proton-deuteron fusion\nand a power-to-the-minus-second law in the spectrum's high-energy limit. An\nanalysis of some prior tokamak discharge data shows that this phenomenon might\nhave been observed before and it may lead to new plasma diagnostics which are\nmore sensitive to the ionic or nuclear degree of freedom.

In MIMO radars with\ncompressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive\nnode forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this\npaper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the\ndata matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based\non knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)\ntechniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new\nMIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either\nperforms matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary\nwaveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random\nsampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center.

To this end, we first\nconsider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized\nstatistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a\nuniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its\nsuboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of\nthe quantized statistics under both hypotheses.

In particular, we show that the Born contribution of massive\nquarks arising from photon-gluon fusion gives zero contribution to the\nlogarithmic integral over the polarization asymmetry $\\int {d\\nu \\over\n\\nu}\\Delta \\sigma(\\nu,Q^2)$ for any photon virtuality. The vanishing of this\nintegral in the Bjorken scaling limit then implies a zero gluon-splitting Born\ncontribution to the Gourdin-Ellis-Jaffe sum rule for polarized structure\nfunctions from massive sea quarks. The vanishing of the polarization asymmetry\nat or near the canonical position predicted by perturbative QCD provides an\nimportant tool for verifying the dominance of the photon-gluon fusion\ncontribution to charm photoproduction and for validating the effectiveness of\nthis process as a measure of the gluon polarization $\\Delta G(x,Q^2)$ in the\nnucleon. The displacement of the asymmetry zero from its canonical position is\nsensitive to the virtuality of the gluon in the photon-gluon fusion subprocess,\nand it can provide a measure of intrinsic and higher-order sea quark\ncontributions.", "authors_ss": ["Stanley J.

The s-channel and the gluon fusion\nprocesses also show distinctive features in spite of their suppressed cross\nsections.
